## Mapping Earthquakes Challenge

The maps api from mapbox.com was used for this project. Steps included creating a MapBox account and then retrieving the access token.

The API key is stored in the `config.js` file which is not included.

The application can be run from a web server. For a local verification and development one can use the `localhost:8000` port to run the index.html file. If you have set up the python environment, you can use the `python -m http.server` command to start the web server on port 8000
